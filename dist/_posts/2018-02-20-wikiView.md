## Build a Wikipedia Viewer 

## Induction 
Had to create a Wikipedia Viewer that can view search results .A challenge that was given to me on FreeCodeCamp  


## Instruction 

create a  Wikipedia Viewer with my own personal style.

 had to have the ability to  search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.

had to have a button that could be clicked and a random Wikipedia entry appears.

given: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random. ,  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page.

## Solution

I started by creating the User Interface , the User Interface had a picture which you could click and it takes you to 
a Random article. A button for submitting search results , with a input box for searching.
The Javascript code that i wrote had to do with comparing the search results with the api results and displaying them in a list format for the
user to see.

### Javascript Code 

`
 $('#search').click(function () {
            var searchTerm = document.getElementById("searchTerm").value;

            var wikiSearchUrl = 'https://crossorigin.me/https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=opensearch&search=' + searchTerm;


            $.getJSON(wikiSearchUrl, function (data) {
                $("#output").html("");
                for (i = 0; i < data[1].length; i++) {
                    console.log(data[1][i]);
                    var keyWord = list = "<li><b>  " + data[1][i] + " </b></li>";
                    var description = "<li>" + data[2][i] + "</li>";
                    var link = "<li> <a href='" + data[3][i] + "'>link To Site</a></li>";


                    $("#output").append(keyWord + description + link);
                }

            });


        });


`
