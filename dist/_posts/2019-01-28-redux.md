## Introduction

My first experience with Redux come when I was learning React when I got comfortable with React I decided to learn Redux. It was not easy at first but with practice, I managed to figure out how redux Works.
in this blog post, I'm going to share with you what  Redux is and how it  works



## body

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It allows you to store the state of your whole application in an object tree within a single store.
the store can be accessed by connecting Redux with React, and by mappingStateToProps in your React Component.



The only way to change the state is to emit an action, which is usually called an action creator
which is just a function that contains
 an object describing what happened.


To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.

A reducer is a simple function that passes in two values
the current state and an action that may (or may not!) update that state.




## Conclusion
I recommend reading the docs. If it seems hard learning redux at first, don't worry once you read the docs and practice by yourself It does become a fun and powerful library to use when building client Side applications.
