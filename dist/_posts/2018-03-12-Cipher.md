# Decode and Encode

## Introduction 
The reason why i decided to write this blog post is because i finally , or think i finally understand the built in function that Javascript has that's ,  fromCharCode and charCodeAt i used both this built in function 
to complete the kata that i got from CodeWars. 

## Instructions 

So the Kata instructed me to create a function that will encrypt a word by more the characterChar 6 times higher then the original characterChar . The should be a function for encrypting and decrypting the code .




## Solution 
### Code
`


function encode(str) {
    var encodedArray = [];
    var finalArray = [];
    

    for (var i in str.split('')) {
        encodedArray.push(str.charCodeAt(i));
    }

    var newEncodeArray = encodedArray.map(a => a * 6);

    for (var i in newEncodeArray) {
        finalArray.push(String.fromCharCode(newEncodeArray[i]));
    }

    return finalArray.join('');


}

function decode(str) {

    var encodedArray = [];
    var finalArray = [];
    

for (var i in str.split('')) {
        encodedArray.push(str.charCodeAt(i));
    }

    var newEncodeArray = encodedArray.map(a => a / 6);

    for (var i in newEncodeArray) {
        finalArray.push(String.fromCharCode(newEncodeArray[i]));
    }

    return finalArray.join('');
    
}


` 
I completed this kata by creating a function which takes in str an empty array for encodedArray and finalArray , looped through the str String array push all the element into an array . Toke that 
same array and i used the map function to multiply every element by 6 , looped though the array that was multiplied by 6 and returned the fromCharCode character which was the number passed in returning the character letters.
Did the same thing with the decode which had the same procedures as the first function but the only change was that it did not multiply each element by 6 , instead divided each element by 6 .   

## Conclusion 

FromCharcode(takes in a number ) and returns a character . CharCodeAt(takes in a letter ) returns a number.
