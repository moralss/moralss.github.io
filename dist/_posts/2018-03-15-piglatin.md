# Pig Latin

## Introduction 
i decided to write a blog post about the pig latin challenge a challenge i got from FreeCodeCamp , because of the fun i had completing this challenge .

## Instructions 

Translate the provided string to pig latin.

Pig Latin takes the first consonant (or consonant cluster) of an English word, moves it to the end of the word and suffixes an "ay".

If a word begins with a vowel you just add "way" to the end.

Input strings are guaranteed to be English words in all lowercase.



## Solution 
### Code
`

 function translatePigLatin(str) {
    var shiftedArray = [];
    var results = "";

    var splitedSting = str.split('');
    vows = (/[aeiou]/g);

    if (vows.test(splitedSting[0])) {
         return str + "way";
    }

    while (!vows.test(splitedSting[0])) {
        shiftedArray.push(splitedSting.shift());
        var results = splitedSting.join('') + shiftedArray.join('') + "ay";

    }


    return results;
 }

`
I attempted this challenge a few times just to make it short as possible and readable .
So i basically created a function called translatePigLatin that takes in a string , checked if the string's first index contains a vow if it does then i just returned the word way at the end of the string ,
if it does not then i shifted meaning i removed all the elements that does not contain a vow at the beginning and moved it to the end of the string and also added a ay.   

## Conclusion 

Fun and exiting !
