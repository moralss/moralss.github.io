# css Grid

## Introduction

 For the last couple of months i have been battling with css styling html content .One thing i could do was make my html content responsive
 for different devices i accomplished that by using bootstrap. But the problem i was having was that i could not design a application according to 
 the idea i had in my mind, on how it would look like. And so i learnt about css Grid and it allowed me to 
 design applications according to my ideas , and decided to write a blog post about css Grid it. 

## What is css Grid  

CSS Grid Layout is a CSS layout method designed for the two-dimensional layout of items on a webpage or application.

## Explanation 

When you want to use css Grid you first have to call a key value pair called display:grid in your css. that allows you to use some of the 
properties in css Grid, then you can use properties like grid-template-columns if you want to define the amount of columns you want , or 
you can use grid-template-rows if you want to define the amount of rows you want. Also get grid-gap which gives spaces between the rows and columns.

## conclusion 

My latest design of the calculator , i styled it using css Grid.
