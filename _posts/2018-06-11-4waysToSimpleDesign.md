## Introduction 

Four Rules of Simple Design is a book written by Corey Haines.
 that speaks about the steps you should follow for good and clean code. 
In my blog post, I am going to share with you the Four Rules of Simple Design.  

## 4 ways to simple design  
* the first Rule speaks about Tests pass

refers to TDD written tests, not automated tests when designing you should write the test first and then write enough 
code to make the test pass. When tests are written it makes it easy to maintain the code 
and add new features  to the code, also helps with verification, 
making sure that everything in your system works accordingly 

* the Second Rule speaks about Expresses Intent

Variables names, Function names and Class Names should Expresses Intent meaning the name given should 
represent what the function is doing or what the variable is storing. This also helps when someone else 
is going through your code it makes it readable and much easier for someone to understand your code
because of the naming expressing intent also for your future self to easily understand what going if changes have
to be made.

 * the Third rule is No duplication 

Means don't repeat yourself, don't have duplicated code its better to just wrap the duplicated code in a function
and call that function. The duplicated code also makes your project consist of a lot of code, a lot of code can make
you vulnerable to bugs.  


* the Last one is Small

functions should be small and have single responsibility. By following the previews rules you  will automatically
get to the last rule of small.   

## Conclusion 

Apply this four rules can make you a great programmer something that I am still working towards.
