# Javascript Closures

## Introduction 

I was given a class test by Theo , on closures and decided to wrote a blog post about closures and share my code example.

## Code 

`
function multiply(firstNumber, secondNumber) {
    if (secondNumber) {
         return firstNumber * secondNumber;
    }
        return function (secondNumber) { return firstNumber * secondNumber; };
    }

`

## Closures 

JavaScript allows you to nest functions and grants the inner function full access to all the variables and functions defined inside the outer function
.However, the outer function does not have access to the variables and functions defined inside the inner function. 
 Also, since the inner function has access to the scope of the outer function, 
the variables and functions defined in the outer function will live longer than the duration of the inner function execution,
if the inner function manages to survive beyond the life of the outer function. 
A closure is created when the inner function is somehow made available to any scope outside the outer function.


## Conclusion 

Closures are a powerful feature in the JavaScript language , and im currently doing research and learning more.
