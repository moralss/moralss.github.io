The Coding Ground being a free software craftsmanship academy. Relies mostly on sponsorships and donations. to be able to educate the next generation of software craftsmen.


I'm happy that they are people out there that believe in The Coding Ground and were willing to donate to the organization. So that we can improve our moral and technical skills. I'm grateful and thankful for the opportunities presented in front of me, being able to learn without paying for education something that was not going to be possible, if it has not for the donations we received, that was towards The Coding Ground. 


Truly making South Africa better.
