## Introduction 

In this blog post, I'm going to share with you my feedback about how codeFest was.
  
## Sub Body 

 Codefest is a free software hackathon that encourages
 students and professionals from all experience levels and backgrounds to 
 work together to develop innovative solutions to help solve real world challenges.

## Body
I'm proud to be part of such a great initiative. We also had an excellent agile 
coach that helped us through our software development processes there were constantly
checking, assisting us whenever we needed help. I saw first hand how important 
communication is when working in a team. 

We were working under pressure but managed to have something to demo to the judges 
there thought what we did was actually pretty cool, even though we did not win ,
we did have fun building out the prototype we were given a small project to
do that had to be functional like a chat app, for the members at Rnb. So
as a team, we had to work with web sockets a technology that we  
not familiarly.

## Conclusion 

Next year's codeFest need to be prepared.
