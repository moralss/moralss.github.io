# creating a portflio page 

## Introduction

Started with my portflio page , a challenge that was given to me on freecodecamp.

## Instructions 

I was instructed to Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage. It had to have the ability to access 
all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling. 

It had to have clickable buttons, a social media link that could be clicked and that takes  you to a social media page , with portfilo pictures that could be displayed on the Webpage.


## solution 

I used the bootstrap grid system to created responsive pictures .Also used bootstrap to create the 
navbar and the footer section. Html for the content and a little bit of css for the styling of the images and text styling.



## conclusion

bootstrap worked well on my Webpage Portflio . I just did not have a enough content about myself to put on my Webpage Portflio.
