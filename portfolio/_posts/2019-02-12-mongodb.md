## Introduction 

In this blog post, I'm going to share with you two ways you can use MongoDB with node.js.

## Body

But first of all, let's discuss what MongoDB is?

MongoDB is an open source database management system (DBMS) that uses a document-oriented database model which supports various forms of data. ... Instead of using tables and rows as in relational databases, the MongoDB architecture is made up of collections and documents.

So there are two ways you can connect to MongoDB first one is through a MongoDB driver.

A driver allows this communication to happen at the programmatic level, so coders can communicate with the database programmatically as opposed to through a client like the mongo shell. Language bindings allow for coders of a particular language to communicate with a database.

The second way is through an ORM like Mongoose. Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB. 

## Conclusion 

I typically prefer using mongoose when working with MongoDB because it provides structure.
