## Introduction 

Today I'm going to share with you a little bit about docker and how to create a simple Dockerfile.

## Body

Docker is a computer program that performs operating-system-level virtualization. It was first released in 2013 and is developed by Docker, Inc. Docker is used for running software packages called containers.
An example of what can be stored inside a container can be your Node.js app or your client-side app like React.
the example below is an example of what you would do if you wanted to containerize a Node.js app.
You would but the below commands inside of a DockerFile.

```
FROM node:alpine
WORKDIR "/app"
COPY ./package.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .

CMD ["npm" , "start"]

```


A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using docker build users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession. 

FROM: specifies an image that has to be used. For example, I'm using an alpine image a Linux distribution.
WORKDIR: makes a working director.
COPY: specifies what to copy to the VM machine.
CMD: specifies what command should be run to start up the server.
